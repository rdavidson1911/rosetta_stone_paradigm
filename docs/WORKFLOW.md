# Rosetta Stone Paradigm Workflow

## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

1. Data Preparation
   1.1. Organize raw packet dissections
   1.2. Validate file formats (JSON, XML, plain text, etc.)
   1.3. Create a consistent naming convention for files

2. Parsing and Extraction
   2.1. Develop parsers for each file format
   2.2. Extract key information from each dissection
   2.3. Create a common data structure to hold extracted information

3. Comparison and Analysis
   3.1. Develop algorithms to compare data across formats
   3.2. Identify common fields and unique representations
   3.3. Analyze syntax differences between formats

4. Integration
   4.1. Design a unified data model to represent all formats
   4.2. Implement data integration process
   4.3. Validate integrated data for consistency

5. Visualization
   5.1. Design comparison table layout
   5.2. Implement table generation logic
   5.3. Create visual aids for syntax highlighting

6. Documentation
   6.1. Document the integration process
   6.2. Create user guide for interpreting the comparison table
   6.3. Update project README with new information

7. Testing and Validation
   7.1. Develop unit tests for parsers and integration logic
   7.2. Perform end-to-end testing of the entire workflow
   7.3. Validate output against original dissections

8. Optimization and Refinement
   8.1. Identify performance bottlenecks
   8.2. Optimize parsing and integration algorithms
   8.3. Refine visualization for clarity and usability

## Next Steps

1. Begin with the Data Preparation phase:
   - Organize the raw packet dissections into a structured directory
   - Verify that all required formats are present and valid
   - Establish a naming convention for easy identification

2. Move on to Parsing and Extraction:
   - Start developing parsers for each file format
   - Focus on extracting common fields across all formats
   - Design a flexible data structure to hold the extracted information

3. Plan for the Comparison and Analysis phase:
   - Brainstorm algorithms for efficient comparison across formats
   - Identify key areas of interest for syntax and structure comparison

4. Set up the project structure for the integration code:
   - Create modules for each major component (parsing, integration, visualization)
   - Establish coding standards and documentation practices

5. Begin implementation, starting with the parsing modules:
   - Implement and test parsers for each format individually
   - Ensure robust error handling and logging

Remember to commit your changes frequently and use descriptive commit messages. As you progress through each phase, update this workflow document to reflect any changes or new insights gained during the development process.
